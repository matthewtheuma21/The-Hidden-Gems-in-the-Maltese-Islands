                        <br>

                    <p>This particular bay is one of the most recommendable places to visit for snorkling lovers. The
                        whole bay crosses a range of depth, still with a sea-bed of sand, which makes of the sea look
                        bright and beautiful. The area around the shoreline is all rocks forming small parts (surrounded
                        with other big rocks) where you can sit on the rocks and paddle your feet in the sea. It’s a
                        nice experience to look around this place, both to relax and to enjoy snorkeling in the crystal
                        clear sea.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On the left side of the area, there is a nice restaurasnt where you can enjoy the view of the
                        bay itself, and you can also rent sunbeds from here. However the section is divided into
                        classes, the sunbeds that are on their own built platforms have their own privacy were no one
                        will be in front of you; however it is important to note that if you rent a sunbed on the sand,
                        many tourists will come block your view and make their own spot. In the afternoons, the place
                        starts to get busy.</p>
