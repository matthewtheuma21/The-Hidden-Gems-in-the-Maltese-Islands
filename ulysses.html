                    <h3>Ulysses Lodge, Xagħra (Gozo)
                    <br>
                    750m away from Ramla l-Ħamra
                    </h3>
                    <h5>last updated: 26/04/2024</h5>

                    <p>To the north-east of Gozo, drowning in the greenery and overlooking a scenic view of Ramla Bay,
                        there lies in ruins Ulysses Lodge. It was built in the 1980s and was used as a hotel and venue
                        for weddings and special events. Though since the beginning, a number of protests started to
                        arise as the neighbouring villages were against a grandiose lodge blocking the view of the most
                        beautiful beach in Gozo.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The lodge was then closed and left abandoned. A number of plans for reconstruction were
                        submitted, but neither they went through nor a request for demolition. And like it usually
                        happens, the former lodge stays in ruins attracting tourists as they go down the hill to the
                        bay.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Most of the lodge is destroyed, but those pieces that survived through years bring vivid
                        pictures to your mind and you can imagine what it could look like back in time. Easily
                        identified kitchen partly keeps decorative tiles as well as some bathrooms. What used to be a
                        pool is now covered in overgrown grass and thorns. But standing there, under the arches and
                        looking at the waves ebbing and flowing, you sense the same feeling of peace as the guests of
                        this lodging 40 years ago or Odysseus himself who found the shore again after his long lasting
                        journey.
