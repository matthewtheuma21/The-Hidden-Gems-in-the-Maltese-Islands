                        <br>
                        2.9km away from Selmun Family Park

                    <p>Along the walk around Selmun’s landscape, you should come across a beautiful clay cliff were
                        friendly
                        pigeons and lovely corals thrive around the crystal waters. The area is surrounded by several
                        standing WW2 military installations (as it was an area were soldiers would attack – as it is in
                        fact
                        next to Fort Campbell). In front of the cliffs, you will notice an island called ‘St.Paul’s
                        Island’,
                        were St.Paul the Apostle is believed to had shipwrecked there in such a violent storm while he
                        was
                        on his way to Rome over 2,000 years ago (introducing christian faith to Malta).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One can decide to kayak or swim to the islands (which is 100m afar) to pay a visit. It is a tiny
                        island, however you will come across a 7m high statue of the Apostle & a Christian cross from
                        1845.
                        Or else, enjoy the beautiful landscape of Selmun.
