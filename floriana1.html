                        <br>

                    <p>A very-well historic garden has recently been open again to the public after restoration, the
                        St.Philips Garden. This garden can be acessed from the left side of the Wignavourt Water Tower,
                        which you will find a green gate there that takes you to a narrow passage where the railway
                        station used to be.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Its location, makes it quite a hidden location, because many people pass from there and not even
                        notice these beautiful gardens. Unfortunatly there isn't much signs that help acknowledge their
                        entrance. I myself couldn't find the entrance immediatly, simply trying Google Maps but it
                        wasn't accurate.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The St.Philips Garden includes one of the biggest fountains in Malta, which is very large in
                        height. The fountain was built to celebrate the construction of the Wignacourt aqueduct. It was
                        originally found in Saint
                        Georgeâ€™s square but was then moved to the Saint Philip Garden grounds. It's a very quiet and
                        peaceful place (not like the Barraka Gardens), and you can still enjoy the beautiful view from a
                        bird's eye.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The other garden can be easily accessed next to the Archbishop's Curia, which is on the right
                        were you can see the gate of the other botanic garden. The garden serves a display for monuments
                        and works being done in many years before. Also a place were you can have a look at many
                        mediterranean plants, including a rich collection of trees, shrubs, potted plants, and some of
                        the biggest cacti we have in Malta as well.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This place before was a private area, owned by Grand Master Pinto dating back in the 18th
                        century. Now its a perfect destination to have a clam and peaceful time for both city guests,
                        other locals and tourists visiting Malta. The garden has also been an open classroom for
                        students studying biology and ecology.
