                    <p>A very-well historic garden has recently been open again to the public after restoration.
                        However, more works on the entrance and of the Sally Port are still to be done as to make the
                        area more accessible. The fountain that can be found in the center of the garden, which was
                        built to celebrate the construction of the Wignacourt aqueduct. It was originally found in Saint
                        George’s square but was then moved to the Saint Philip Garden grounds.
                        <br>
                        <br>
