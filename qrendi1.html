                    <p>’Il-Maqluba’ is a sinkhole that appeared back in 1343 during a violent storm (possibly an
                        earthquake), situated in the village of Qrendi. The sinkhole is composed of blue clay,
                        globigerina
                        limestone and dominant trees. One particular species lying there is the sandarac gum tree
                        ‘Siġra
                        Tal-Għargħar’ which naturally occures in North Africa and Southern Spain; whilst in Malta we
                        only
                        have in this sinkhole and some areas in the north. The sinkhole is also a nesting site for
                        the
                        national bird of Malta. Moreover there is a small chapel of San Mattew on the edge of the
                        sinkhole,
                        which has been existing probably around the 11th century.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        However, it is forbidden to venture down to the bottom-most level of the sinkhole, because
                        its
                        protected. But one can admire the sinkhole from a midway viewing and take photos.
                        One big legend about the sinkhole says that the place was inhabited by people who lived such
                        dissolute lives that a neighbour warned them against their sinful ways, without them taking
                        notice.
                        God therefore wished to punish the sinners by engulfing the hamlet that there was, saving
                        only the
                        wise people there. The angels then threw a fragment into the sea, creating the isle of
                        Filfla. It is
                        believed that a nun was saved while praying in the small chapel during the occurence.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After visiting the sinkhole, one must pay a visit to the beautiful ‘Blue Grotto’, which is a
                        20
                        minute walk/three minutes by car. The ‘Blue Grotto’ is a complex of seven sea caves in front
                        of the
                        little islet of Filfa, were you can swim and dive in the very clear, clean and deep waters.
                        There
                        are also boat trips to the caves, which is believed to be the best way to experience the
                        beauty of
                        the area. The complex comprises a massive and very impressive arch, which was resulted by
                        the harsh
                        waves along the years.
