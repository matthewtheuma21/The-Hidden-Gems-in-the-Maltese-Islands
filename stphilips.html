                    <h3>St. Philips Hospital - St.Venera
                        <br>
                        1.4km away from Msida Skate Park
                    </h3>
                    <h5>last updated: 23/04/2024</h5>

                    <p>100-bedded capacity hospital located in Santa Venera was closed in 2012 after running into
                        financial problems. Most of its entrances are blocked up with rubble wall, however there are
                        some few other entrances to enter, and you can still explore the whole building and its rooms.
                        Some rooms are left with burnt chemicals spread on the floor, many documents from past patients
                        with their information, broken televisions and other prdocucts dating back to when they were
                        used at that time (simply a coca cola bottle with the expire date being on 2010). Some rooms at
                        the underground level are completly dark, thats where one can find big mechanisms that were
                        being used.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So <b>please do be aware when visiting this place</b>, to be careful of the surroundings and bring a
                        flashlight with you. Also don't go alone. It is believed that some or two live there, as you may
                        find rooms with personal belongings folded nicely until now, so its very clear that this is
                        true.
                    </p>
