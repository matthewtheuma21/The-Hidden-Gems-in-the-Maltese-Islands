                    <br>
                    200m away from the city gate of Valletta
                </h3>

                <p>This classical five star hotel surrounded by gorgeous landscaped gardens is both a big landmark and a
                    luxury retreat. It blends history, culture and luxury together as a hotel. In addition, the hotel is
                    just outside the vibrant capital of Valletta on the edge of the bastions, which make it an excellent
                    location. The construction of the Phoenicia was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, when
                    the building was requisitioned by the British military to be used by Royal Air Force personnel. It
                    was then highly targeted by an air raid on April 27th, 1942; estimated over 100 bombs were dropped
                    on the grounds. In 1948, the hotel was finally opened, featuring a beautiful spa, an amazing outdoor
                    pool (with a glass panel on the edge, opposite the beautiful view of Malta from the top), retail
                    offerings on designer sunglasses to high-class perfumes and more.

                    Its interior includes pretty authentic tiled floors, uplifted colours of the mediterranean (blue and
                    white) and textures in old-world elegance mixed with modern style. It has been refurbished through
                    the years, extending another floor.
