                    <br>

                    <p>White Rocks, otherwise known as the ghost complex of the Maltese Islands, is a derelict spot
                        surrounded by stunning views of the Mediterranean and the Maltese coastline. It was built by
                        British Forces in the 1960s. Back then, the area was known as the St Patrickâ€™s Officers Married
                        Quarters and was used for accommodation purposes. When the british military personnel left
                        Malta, White Rocks was handed over to the government and was gradually converted into a holiday
                        complex. It became a prime location for accommodation housing language students studying in
                        Malta during the summer months until 1995, as it was then left abandoned.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It has been quite damaged due to natural causes and vandalism (with broken glass scattered on
                        the floor and clear areas were the bricks seem decaying on the stairs), however it well serves
                        as a graffiti art museum both inside and outside. Graffiti artists have come to this place,
                        painted a whole room as a one single piece of art, or made use of the big side walls of the
                        complex, featuring a giant painting that can be seen from the coast road.
