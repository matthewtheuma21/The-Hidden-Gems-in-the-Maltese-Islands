                    <p>A large hidden cave that is a bit difficult to access, as it is quite hidden. It lies behind an
                        abandoned block of baroques, between an area of plants and dry grass.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Once you walk down the stairs, you’ll come across a whole area of deep waters. Swimming through
                        the dark yet vibrant waters of Ħarq il-Ħammiem easily evoke a unique experience of a lost world
                        that would otherwise largely remain unseen. This cave is said to be the biggest in our Maltese
                        Islands, reaching a maximum depth of 52 metres. However its extremly dark. In order to see whats
                        around you’ll definetly need a powerful torch, not even from your phone is enough.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The cave is known to house a species of albino shrimp, not found anywhere else in Malta. You may
                        also find writings on the walls, dating back to the early 1900’s still clearly encraved on the
                        rocks.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Unfortunatly, due to ongoing works on the new upcoming tower replacing the old ITS school, the
                        cave lies under the development. People are on ongoing fear of the cave collapsing. Vloggers and
                        explorers have found that the underwater cavern appears littered with large chunks of rock
                        debris.
