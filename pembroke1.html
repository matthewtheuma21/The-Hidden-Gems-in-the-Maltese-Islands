                    <h3>Pembroke
                        <br>
                        220m away from the clock tower of Pembroke
                    </h3>
                    <h5>last updated: 19/04/2024</h5>

                    <p>This sculpture was build behind the purpose of having all our museums and attractions closed
                        during
                        the covid pandemic, being the concept of community outreach and art in public spaces (which
                        has now
                        gained a new dimension). The sculpture symbolises the architecture of the British surrounded
                        around
                        Pembroke, specifically from the clock tower.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Originally, the completion of the sculpture was meant to be complemented by a live
                        performance piece
                        by Nicole Bugeja, however COVID-19 requirements led to a change in plan, with the project
                        instead
                        being filmed at different times of the day, in different seasons, in different weather,
                        light,
                        temperature and noise conditions.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The sculpture lies within a pretty picnic area facing the Pembroke clock tower, surrounded
                        by trees
                        and open spaces.
