                <h2>last updated: 13/04/2024</h2>

                <p>Currently a student in MCAST Mosta, taking Bachelor of Arts in Graphic Design Lvl 5. I am really into
                    photography, creating art on such digital softwares and making forms of advertisment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I always have been dedicated to designing my work in a vibrant layout, from writing my school notes
                    to anything that we as graphic designers create. However, I love making use of monochromatic/black +
                    white palettes with a sense of aesthetic in my work.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Maybe my least favourite medium, would be working on animation, as its not really my go-to to work
                    with, because I am more into creating printed visuals and design.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also have a passion for travelling around the world, exploring new stuff and achieving goals to
                    every step of my life.
