                <h2>last updated: 03/05/2024</h2>

                <p>Currently a student in MCAST Mosta, taking Bachelor of Arts in Graphic Design Lvl 5. I am really into
                    photography, creating art on such digital softwares and making forms of advertisment. Have also been
                    recently given the opportunity by my cousin to start learning video editing and explore. And it has
                    been amazing, its come to my acknowledgment that its really fun, planning how to edit and master the
                    scenes, its just like a puzzle. It's also an amazing experience, as one can easily make a lot of
                    income from this.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In terms of design, I always have been dedicated to designing my work in a vibrant layout, from
                    writing my school notes
                    to anything that we as graphic designers create. However, I love making use of this sense of
                    monochromatic/black +
                    white palettes, keeping it modern. Another style I like to go for in some of my work, is a
                    modern-grunge aesthetic, Y2K style into any design. I also believe that somewhat is considered
                    against the rules of graphic design, some should be used.

                    Maybe my least favourite medium, would be working on animation, as its not really my go-to to work
                    with, because I am more into creating printed visuals, coding and digital advertisment. However as a
                    graphic designer, its a must to know how to animate. The minimum is at least knowing how to animate
                    your logo or set up an intro-animation to your work. Which I can, but I have zero patience to create
                    animations on an extreme level!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also have a passion for travelling around the world, exploring new stuff and achieving goals to
                    every step of my life.
