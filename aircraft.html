                    <h3>The Rainbow Aircraft, Monte Kristo (Siġġiewi)
                        <br>
                        4.8km away from the Malta International Airport
                    </h3>
                    <h5>last updated: 23/04/2024</h5>

                    <p>The last operator of the rainbow aircraft, de Havilland Canada Dash 7 was said to be Tassilli
                        Airlines,operating until 1998. It's believed that
                        it has been in Malta since 2004 (inside the Malta International Airport). MonteKristo then have
                        bought it in 2011 for to be an attraction there, but then unfortunatly it was left abandoned.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Remains of the seats and mechanisms are still left there. One can take a picture posing as a
                        pilot (pretending to drive the plane), as the steering wheel is still attached. Some parts are
                        already being vandalised by visitors, however its not completly destructed from the inside. You
                        can also easily climb on top of the plane as their are purposely built stairs from concrete for
                        the visitors.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Nicolas Bamert, who is a Swiss Urban Artist is the person behind the rainbow design painted on
                        the plane.
