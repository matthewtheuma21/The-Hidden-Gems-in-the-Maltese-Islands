                    <h3>The Lost Hotel of Mellieħa
                        <br>
                        1.4km away from Għadira Bay
                    </h3>
                    <h5>last updated: 26/04/2024</h5>

                    <p>This is an abandoned building almost entirely hidden among the trees of Foresta 2000 just beneath
                        the Red Tower of Mellieha. Many people go for a walk and pass next to it. The view is amazing,
                        because you get to see the biggest beach in Malta from a bird view.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It was planned to have six floors of apratments are terraced into the landscape between its
                        sloping spine walls, so that at no point does the structure intrude more than one level above
                        the contours of the existing site. At the top was planned to have a clubhouse with an outside
                        pool and terrace, offering its panoramic views. But the decision to halt its construction was
                        because the hillside began to give way, leaving this ruin behind.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The place now is how it is being swallowed up by nature. It is surrounded by mature trees, there
                        are roots bursting through the tiles, and walls are being shifted over by the same force of
                        nature, as if demanding to reclaim its property.
