                    <h3>Coral Lagoon - Mellieħa
                    </h3>
                    <h5>last updated: 19/04/2024</h5>

                    <p>Make sure you visit the beautiful cave (naturally formed) in the north of Malta. The lagoon is
                        one of the most breathtaking locations for divers and swimmers, were you can lay your eyes upon
                        stunning corals such as golden cup corals and different species of starfish! However you must be
                        very careful.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You may have seen “Instagram-worthy shots” of people jumping off the lagoon’s cliffs, which is
                        not forbidden because the lagoon has deep waters, however it is still not safe to jump,
                        especially if its not nice weather. If its very windy or rainy, never swim there, because there
                        are no safety ladders to get up from and it would be exxtremly dangerous to get out, especially
                        for those who don’t know how to swim very well. The cave is also very high, one person jumping
                        from that height can lead to serious injuries. There are no stairs around the cave or any
                        passageway to the ground, you’d have to swim to the small archway to get out and you’ll be
                        exposed to the rough open seas.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So make sure to wear sturdy footwear, pack water and plenty of sunblock, whilst enjoying the
                        beautiful cave and crystal-clear water.

                        <b>How to get there?</b><br>
                        It is situated near ‘Armier Bay’ and ‘L-Aħrax tal-Mellieħa’ campsite, but to get there its a bit
                        of a rocky uneven track. You can drive towards the little ‘Chapel of Immaculate Conception’ and
                        turn left, or drive towards the Armier Bay and from there head towards the Aħrax campsite. From
                        one of these points, park your car and walk uphill until you start noticing a hole in the rocky
                        surface in front of you.
