                    <h3>Fort Champbell, Mellieħa
                        <br>
                        1km away from Rdum Il-Biez & St.Paul Islands
                    </h3>
                    <h5>last updated: 26/04/2024</h5>

                    <p>This fortification was the last fort built by the British in Malta. The main scope for the
                        building of Fort Campbell was to protect the approaches for Mellieha and St. Paul’s Bays. That
                        is because there were no defences to protect these two approaches. The buildings of the fort
                        included the command post, gun emplacements, water tank, direction posts, barrack accommodation
                        and magazines.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Its most important structure was the Battery Observation Post, which was situated roughly in the
                        middle of the area, still accessible there till today. A big circular hole inside the ground,
                        with a narrow corrirdor surrounding it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Today its completely abandoned, some parts are left unprotected and dangerous to visitors. Some
                        people have stolen structural beams that were left there, and some have vandalised some areas
                        around with illegal graffiti. It is a great pity that it has been left unattended for so many
                        years, accessible to one and all, and yet with no one ensuring that it is well kept.
