                        <br>
                        950m away from the sand waves in Għasri
                    </h3>
                    <h5>last updated: 19/04/2024</h5>

                    <p>A limestone natural arch on the north-western coast of the island of Gozo, located at the end of
                        the valley ‘Wied il-Mielaħ’. Unfortunatly it can’t really be seen well, as the passage only ends
                        halfway through, however one can still see it. This arch got quite well-known after the collapse
                        of the Azure Window, as people wanted to have a new main touristic site, so they expanded the
                        staircase so that divers can enter the water here.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The area around the arch, is all characterised with steep cliffs and caves that one can explore.
                        Nearby, there also is the ‘Giordan Lighthouse’, were there is a panaromic viewpoint of Gozo and
                        the iconic sand waves of Għasri.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Only a 13 minute walk, takes you the iconic sand waves in Għasri, which were formed by the wind
                        in many years. Highly recommendable for geographic lovers and people who like to explore and
                        hike around. Along the coast, there are many other nice places to pay a visit, such as the salt
                        pans and the beautiful beaches there.
