                    <h3>The Jesus Tree
                        <br>
                        950m away from Mdina Gate
                    </h3>
                    <h5>last updated: 19/04/2024</h5>

                    <p>According to a Maltese legend, a local tree was struck by lightning many years ago, which
                        appeared the unmistakable likeness of Jesus Christ on the Cross.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But, alas, it wasn't to last. When the Jesus Tree was uprooted in 2008, locals rang the local
                        council incessantly, begging for the tree to be saved. And when, almost a year later, the tree
                        showed signs of extreme deterioration
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Take the road from Zebbug to Mdina. After leaving Zebbug, at the base of Mdina, there's a
                        round-about. Proceed up towards Mdina, and the tree is located approximately half way up on
                        right-hand side. You'll notice first all the flowers, plaques and homage that locals place daily
                        at the foot of the tree. Now, only the trunks remain due to ongoing works in the local, but the
                        Crucifix is still there.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you keep walking up the hill, you'll come across the two beautiful villages on the hill;
                        Rabat and Mdina (the old silent city). This is a must-visit, and get to explore more Malta's
                        history and culture.
