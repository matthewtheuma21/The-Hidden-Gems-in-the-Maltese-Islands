                    <h3>Għar Ir-Riħ - Ħal-Far
                    </h3>
                    <h5>last updated: 19/04/2024</h5>

                    <p>In the limits of Birzebbuġia & Ħal-Far, one can find many caves accessible behind the beautiful
                        cliffs, all with interesting legends about them. Għar Ir-Riħ ‘s entrance is hidden behind a
                        large rock, and as you enter you will find various rock formations. At the end of it comes to
                        another mouth, that overlooks the sea with wonderful views, a must-take photo here. Becareful of
                        the current passing there, a lot of wind passes through these caves and along the valley.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There is another open cave that can be seen on the right side of the small valley, called ‘Għar
                        In-Nagħaġ’. Back when the first excavations of these caves were being taken (dating back in
                        1936), about three and a half meters inward from the entrance, a skeleton was found, some
                        pottery dating back from the Bronze Age and beautiful walls formed by water.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Another nameless cave is situated from the left side onwards of the valley, its entrance is a
                        small tunnel (so you have crawl to enter) and you can find a small nice cave, were you can
                        notice some bellholes that were formed by water.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Try this:</b><br>
                        While your walking around the area, find any hard object and strike it onto another flat rock
                        that there is over there, you’ll find out that they make a bell-like sound.
