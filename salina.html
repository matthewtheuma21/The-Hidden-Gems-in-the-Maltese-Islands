                    <h3>Salina Catacombs, Naxxar
                        <br>
                        1.2km away from Rdum Il-Biez & St.Paul Islands
                    </h3>

                    <p>These catacombs have considerable archaeological significance. This group of burials is situated
                        in an area known as Taâ€™ Latnija, a quiet location to the south-east of the church of the
                        Annunciation of the Virgin. The group consists of more than 15 small hypogea, mostly cut in a
                        quarry. The size of this burial site suggests that a sizeable community must have lived in the
                        area.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Nowadays, only three of the five largest hypogea are accessible, four of which are dug into a
                        squarish section of the quarry. These are considerably small hypogea but can still provide us
                        with ample information on the development of such hypogea. The fifth hypogeum is dug a few
                        metres away from the first four. This is also the best cut and very few local hypogea can
                        parallel the mastery shown in it. Practically all the tombs, even the unfinished ones, are, in
                        fact, heavily decorated with elements that point towards a Christian origin.

                        Unfortunatly, it smells really bad inside as some people seemed to have used them as toilets. So
                        this is why this place is categorised in the Abandoned Spots.
