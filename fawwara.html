                    <h3>Il-Fawwara Hamlet, Siġġiewi
                        <br>
                        2.6km away from Dingli Cliffs
                    </h3>
                    <h5>last updated: 23/04/2024</h5>

                    <p>According to a maltese legend, in this idyllic location between Rabat and Dingli, Ġlorma Ciantar
                        had many fields in the area that were affected by the lack of rain back in the early 17th
                        century. Ġlorma made a promise to Our Lady that if the water of the spring came back (which lies
                        underneath the chapel), she would build a chapel dedicated to Her in one of her fields. Lateer
                        on, water began to gush out, more than ever before, and farmers returned back to their daily
                        work. Then Ġlorma visited notary Pietro Paolo Vincella in 1616 (having saved enough money) to
                        build the small chapel that lies in Fawwara till today.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It was built as a square-shaped form and on its four pillars rests a small dome without a spire,
                        and two coat of arms (one for the Ciantar family and one for the Confraternity of Our Lady of
                        Charity) on the door. Inside is simple, but quite particular with its amount of coat of arms. It
                        is worth the visit as the church is still in a very good condition. To reach this place, one is
                        to take the road that leads to Rabat from Siġġiewi, and on the way you should look out for a
                        statue of the souls in purgatory, and then take a left turn and keep on going until you reach
                        two chapels.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Fawwara is not only known for its beauty and spring water, but also for its history and legends.
                        Some dating back to the 13th century were Arabs tortured and killed seven young girls who all
                        lived in Fawwara between 1270 and 1280. But no matter how much they were tortured, they would
                        not give up their christian faith.
